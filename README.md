# Bespoke.js

### DIY Presentation Micro-Framework

[Bespoke.js](http://markdalgleish.com/projects/bespoke.js) is a super minimal (1KB min'd and gzipped), modular presentation library for modern browsers, designed to foster a rich [plugin ecosystem](#plugins).

The core library [sets up the presentation](#javascript), provides a simple [control API](#control-api) and manages [events](#events). Any other functionality is implemented as a [plugin](#plugins).

Joining the Bespoke.js ecosystem is simple with the suite of official [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generators:
 - [Bespoke.js Generator](https://github.com/bespokejs/generator-bespoke)
 - [Bespoke.js Plugin Generator](https://github.com/bespokejs/generator-bespokeplugin)
 - [Bespoke.js Theme Generator](https://github.com/bespokejs/generator-bespoketheme)

## Creating a Presentation

Due to the highly modular nature of Bespoke.js, the quickest way to get started is with [Bespoke.js Generator](https://github.com/bespokejs/generator-bespoke), a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator that scaffolds a boilerplate presentation with a [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) build system.

Assuming you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed, in a blank directory:

```bash
$ npm install -g generator-bespoke
$ yo bespoke
```

In your newly scaffolded project, you can use the following Gulp tasks:

 * ```$ gulp serve``` to run a preview server with LiveReload.
 * ```$ gulp deploy``` to deploy to GitHub Pages.
 * ```$ gulp``` to compile static assets to 'public'.

For more detailed instructions, check out the [Bespoke.js Generator](https://github.com/bespokejs/generator-bespoke) repo.

If you'd prefer to craft a new presentation from scratch, you can install Bespoke.js from [npm](http://npmjs.org) with `npm install bespoke`, [Bower](http://bower.io) with `bower install bespoke.js`, or manually download either the [production version][min] or the [development version][max]. The Bespoke.js core is extremely lightweight, so you'll probably want to include some [plugins](#plugins).

[min]: https://raw.github.com/bespokejs/bespoke/master/dist/bespoke.min.js
[max]: https://raw.github.com/bespokejs/bespoke/master/dist/bespoke.js

## Basic Usage

### Loading Bespoke

Bespoke.js is shipped in a [UMD format](https://github.com/umdjs/umd), meaning that `bespoke` and its plugins are available as CommonJS/AMD modules or browser globals.

### Markup

It's completely up to you which tags you use, but the following is a good starting point:

```html
<article id="presentation">
  <section>Slide 1</section>
  <section>Slide 2</section>
  <section>Slide 3</section>
</article>
```

#### JavaScript

To create a new presentation, Bespoke.js provides the `from(selector[, plugins])` method, which takes a selector or element reference and an array of [plugins](#plugins), and returns a [deck instance](#deck-instances).

```js
var deck = bespoke.from('#presentation', [plugins]);

// Next slide
deck.next();

// Previous slide
deck.prev();

// Go to a specific slide
deck.slide(0);

// Get the active slide index
deck.slide(); // 0
```

By default, all non-script child elements of the resolved parent element become slides.
You can customize this behavior by passing a custom selector.

## Plugins

### Official Plugins

All official plugins can be installed from npm or Bower, e.g. `$ npm install bespoke-keys` or `$ bower install bespoke-touch`

 - [bespoke-keys](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke-keys) for keyboard and remote control interaction.
 - [bespoke-touch](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke-touch) for touch interaction.
 - [bespoke-classes](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke-classes) for deck status classes.
 - [bespoke-bullets](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke-bullets) for animated bullet lists.
 - [bespoke-scale](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke-scale) for responsive slide scaling.
 - [bespoke-hash](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke-hash) for hash routing.
 - [bespoke-backdrop](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke-backdrop) for animated backdrop elements.
 - [bespoke-state](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke-state) for slide-specific deck styles.
 - [bespoke-progress](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke-progress) for progress bars.
 - [bespoke-forms](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke-forms) for form element support.
 - [bespoke-loop](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke-loop) for looped presentations.
 - [bespoke-vcr](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke-vcr) for recording and playback.

### All Plugins

You can view the [full list of Bespoke.js plugins on npm](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/keyword/bespoke-plugin) by browsing the [bespoke-plugin](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/keyword/bespoke-plugin) keyword.

### Using Plugins

All official plugins are provided in a [UMD format](https://github.com/umdjs/umd), meaning they are available as CommonJS/AMD modules or browser globals.

For example, if you're using CommonJS modules via [browserify](http://browserify.org/) or [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), it would look something like this:

```js
var bespoke = require('bespoke'),
  classes = require('bespoke-classes'),
  keys = require('bespoke-keys'),
  touch = require('bespoke-touch');

var deck = bespoke.from('#presentation', [
  classes(),
  keys(),
  touch()
]);
```

If you're using browser globals, all official plugins are added to the `bespoke.plugins` object, for example:

```js
var deck = bespoke.from('#presentation', [
  bespoke.plugins.classes(),
  bespoke.plugins.keys(),
  bespoke.plugins.touch()
]);
```

The first slide is activated automatically after all plugins are called unless one of those plugins has already activated a slide.

## Themes

### Official Themes

 - [Cube](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke-theme-cube) &mdash; [(view demo)](http://bespokejs.github.io/bespoke-theme-cube)
 - [Voltaire](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke-theme-voltaire) &mdash; [(view demo)](http://bespokejs.github.io/bespoke-theme-voltaire)
 - [Nebula](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke-theme-nebula) &mdash; [(view demo)](http://bespokejs.github.io/bespoke-theme-nebula)

As with plugins, all official themes can be installed from npm or Bower, e.g. `$ npm install bespoke-theme-cube` or `$ bower install bespoke-theme-voltaire`

### All Themes

You can view the [full list of Bespoke.js themes on npm](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/keyword/bespoke-theme) by browsing the [bespoke-theme](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/keyword/bespoke-theme) keyword.

### Using Themes

Themes are included just like any other plugin:

```js
var bespoke = require('bespoke'),
  cube = require('bespoke-theme-cube'),
  keys = require('bespoke-keys'),
  touch = require('bespoke-touch');

var deck = bespoke.from('#presentation', [
  cube(),
  keys(),
  touch()
]);
```

If you're using browser globals, all official themes are added to the `bespoke.themes` object, for example:

```js
var deck = bespoke.from('#presentation', [
  bespoke.themes.cube(),
  bespoke.plugins.keys(),
  bespoke.plugins.touch()
]);
```

## Advanced Usage

### From HTMLElement

If you already have a reference to a DOM node, you can pass it directly to the `from` method.

```js
bespoke.from(element);
```

### Slide Selector

You can specify which elements become slides by passing an options Hash containing the key `parent` and, optionally, the key `slides`) to the `from` method.
The value of either key can be a CSS selector or a DOM node.

```js
bespoke.from({ parent: selectorOrElement, slides: selectorOrElementList });
```

For example:

```js
bespoke.from({ parent: '#presentation', slides: '#presentation > section' });
```

This advanced usage allows you to include auxiliary HTML inside the parent element, skip slides that don't match the selector or explicitly filter out slides before passing on the collection.

### Deck Instances

Deck instances are provided to plugins and returned when instantiating a presentation. The following properties are available on each instance.

*Note: The optional [`eventData`](#custom-event-data) parameter is an object that will be merged with the `event` object in subsequent [event handlers](#events).*

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>next(<em>[eventData]</em>)</strong></td>
    <td>Next slide.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>prev(<em>[eventData]</em>)</strong></td>
    <td>Previous slide.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>slide([<em>index[, eventData]]</em>)</strong></td>
    <td>Get or set the active slide index.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>on(<em>event, callback</em>)</strong></td>
    <td>Attach <a href="#events">event handlers</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>off(<em>event, callback</em>)</strong></td>
    <td>Unbind <a href="#events">event handlers</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>fire(<em>event[, eventData]</em>)</strong></td>
    <td>Fire custom events. <em>This method is primarily designed for plugin authors.</em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>parent</strong></td>
    <td>The deck's parent element</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>slides</strong></td>
    <td>An array of slide elements</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>destroy</strong></td>
    <td>Fire the destroy event. <em>This method can be used to remove the deck from the DOM.</em></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Events

##### Binding Events

Events are bound via the [deck instance](#deck-instances). Each event is passed an event object containing a reference to the relevant slide and its index.

```js
deck.on(eventName, function(event) {
  event.slide; // Relevant slide
  event.index; // Index of relevant slide

  // Prevent default functionality (for deck interaction events only)
  return false;
});
```

##### Standard Events

In most cases, you will only need to use these standard events.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>activate</strong></td>
    <td>A slide has been activated. <strong>event.slide</strong> is the <em>activated</em> slide.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>deactivate</strong></td>
    <td>A slide has been deactivated. <strong>event.slide</strong> is the <em>deactivated</em> slide.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>destroy</strong></td>
    <td>Presentation is about to be destroyed, it's time for clean-up.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

##### Deck Interaction Events

These events are fired when the deck has been interacted with, but *before* the interaction has had any effect.

This allows you to intercept the default behaviour by returning `false` from the event handler.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>next</strong></td>
    <td>The next slide has been requested, even if last slide is active. <strong>event.slide</strong> is the <em>current</em> slide.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>prev</strong></td>
    <td>The previous slide has been requested, even if first slide is active. <strong>event.slide</strong> is the <em>current</em> slide.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>slide</strong></td>
    <td>A specific slide has been requested. <strong>event.slide</strong> is the <em>requested</em> slide.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

##### Unbinding events

When binding events, the `on` method returns a function that can be used to remove the event handler.

```js
var off = deck.on('activate', function() {
  // ...
});

// Unbind event
off();
```

You can also use the `off` method. However, you must use the same function reference that was used when registering the event.

```js
// Bind event
deck.on('activate', onActivate);

// Unbind event
deck.off('activate', onActivate);
```

## Creating Plugins

Want a boilerplate plugin? Use the official [Bespoke.js Plugin Generator](https://github.com/bespokejs/generator-bespokeplugin).

If you'd like to learn by example, check out the [list of existing plugins](#plugins).

### Basic Plugins

Plugins are simply functions that are called when presentations are created. They are passed a [deck instance](#deck-instances) which allows you to interact with the deck's state, bind events and modify its elements.

To be consistent with the suite of official Bespoke.js plugins, it is highly recommended that you implement your plugin as a function that takes configuration and returns a plugin function.

```js
// Creating the plugin
var myPlugin = function() {
  return function() {
    deck.on('activate', function(e) {
      console.log('Activated slide ' + (e.index + 1) + ' of ' + deck.slides.length);
    });
  }
};
```

The plugin can now be provided in the plugins array when using the `from(selector[, plugins])` method.

```js
// Using the plugin
bespoke.from('#presentation', [
  myPlugin()
]);
```

### Plugins with Options

If your plugin needs some configurability, your plugin factory function can take options and return a configured plugin function.

```js
// Creating the plugin with options
var myPlugin = function(options) {
  return function(deck) {
    var showTotal = options && options.showTotal;

    deck.on('activate', function(e) {
      console.log('Activated slide ' + (e.index + 1) +
        (showTotal ? ' of ' + deck.slides.length : ''));
    });
  }
};

// Using the plugin with options
bespoke.from('#presentation', [
  myPlugin({ showTotal: true })
]);
```

### Custom Event Data

Additional event data can be supplied to `next`, `prev` and `slide`, which is merged with the final `event` object in subsequent event handlers.

This functionality is particularly useful if you need to differentiate between events caused by your plugin, and those caused by your end users or other plugins.

```js
var myPlugin = function() {
  return function(deck) {

    // Differentiating our plugin's events
    deck.on('activate', function(event) {
      if (event.foo === 'bar') {
        // Triggered by my plugin...
      } else {
        // Triggered by end user, or another plugin...
      }
    });

    // Providing custom event data
    deck.next({
      foo: 'bar'
    });

  };
}
```

## Creating Themes

Themes are essentially just plugins that also happen to insert styles into the page.

You can quickly scaffold a boilerplate theme project with the official [Bespoke.js Theme Generator](https://github.com/bespokejs/generator-bespoketheme).
